# Challenge 171: Streaming & Real-time Data Processing

## Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert

### Overview
Build streaming systems with Server-Sent Events (SSE), chunked streaming, backpressure handling, stream processing pipelines, and reactive patterns.

### Key Concepts

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**
   - HTTP/1.1 text/event-stream
   - Connection persistence
   - Event formatting
   - Automatic reconnection

2. **Streaming Patterns**
   - Chunked transfer encoding
   - Stream buffering
   - Resource cleanup
   - Connection lifecycle

3. **Backpressure Handling**
   - Flow control
   - Queue management
   - Consumer pacing
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Stream Processing**
   - Map/filter/reduce operations
   - Stateful transformations
   - Windowing operations
   - Time-based aggregation

5. **Real-time Patterns**
   - Event sourcing
   - Change data capture
   - Observable patterns
   - Reactive streams

### Learning Outcomes
- Implement SSE servers
- Handle streaming I/O
- Implement backpressure
- Build stream processors

### Challenges
- Create SSE server
- Build backpressure-aware queue
- Implement stream transformation pipeline
- Create real-time event aggregator
- Build responsive streaming client
