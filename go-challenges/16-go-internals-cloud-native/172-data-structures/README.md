# Challenge 172: Advanced Data Structures

## Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert

### Overview
Implement sophisticated data structures including Bloom filters, consistent hashing, tries, skip lists, and lock-free concurrent structures.

### Key Concepts

1. **Bloom Filters**
   - Probabilistic membership testing
   - False positive rates
   - Multiple hash functions
   - Scalable bloom filters

2. **Consistent Hashing**
   - Ring-based distribution
   - Virtual nodes
   - Minimal key redistribution
   - Load balancing

3. **Trie/Radix Tree**
   - Prefix matching
   - Autocomplete
   - Space efficiency
   - Path compression

4. **Skip Lists**
   - Probabilistic balance
   - O(log n) operations
   - Simpler than balanced trees
   - Concurrent-friendly

5. **Lock-Free Structures**
   - CAS operations
   - Non-blocking algorithms
   - Compare-and-swap
   - Memory ordering

6. **Concurrent Data Structures**
   - Thread-safe maps
   - Concurrent queues
   - Lock-free stacks
   - Wait-free algorithms

### Learning Outcomes
- Implement specialized data structures
- Optimize for specific use cases
- Handle concurrent access safely
- Analyze performance characteristics

### Challenges
- Create Bloom filter with custom hash functions
- Implement consistent hashing ring
- Build trie for autocomplete
- Implement skip list with range queries
- Create lock-free counter
