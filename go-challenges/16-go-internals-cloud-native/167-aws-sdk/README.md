# Challenge 167: AWS SDK Integration

## Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert

### Overview
Master AWS SDK v2 integration with comprehensive S3, SQS, and Lambda operations. Implement production-grade patterns with mocking, error handling, and retries.

### Key Concepts

1. **AWS S3 Operations**
   - Upload/download operations
   - Presigned URLs
   - Object metadata
   - Multipart uploads
   - Batch operations

2. **AWS SQS Messaging**
   - Message publishing
   - Consumer patterns
   - Batch operations
   - Visibility timeouts
   - Dead-letter queues

3. **AWS Lambda Invocation**
   - Synchronous invocation
   - Asynchronous invocation
   - Error handling
   - Response processing

4. **Error Handling & Retries**
   - Exponential backoff
   - Retry policies
   - Transient vs permanent errors
   - Circuit breaker pattern

5. **Testing & Mocking**
   - Mock AWS services
   - LocalStack integration
   - Stub responses
   - Error simulation

6. **Performance Considerations**
   - Connection pooling
   - Concurrent requests
   - Rate limiting
   - Cost optimization

### Learning Outcomes
- Implement AWS service integrations
- Handle AWS-specific errors
- Optimize AWS API usage
- Test with mock services

### Challenges
- Create S3 file operations with retries
- Build SQS producer/consumer system
- Implement Lambda invocation handler
- Mock AWS services for testing
- Implement sophisticated retry logic
