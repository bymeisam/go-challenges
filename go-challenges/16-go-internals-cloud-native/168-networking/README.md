   - Connection state management

2. **Connection Pooling**
   - Connection reuse
   - Pool sizing strategies
   - Idle connection management
   - Connection validation

3. **Load Balancing**
   - Round-robin distribution
   - Least connections algorithm
   - Weighted balancing
   - Health checks

4. **Reverse Proxy**
   - Request forwarding
   - Response handling
   - Header manipulation
   - Connection proxying

5. **Advanced Features**
   - HTTP/2 server push
   - Connection multiplexing
   - Keep-alive management
   - Graceful shutdown

6. **Performance**
   - Throughput optimization
   - Latency reduction
   - Resource management
   - Concurrent connections
