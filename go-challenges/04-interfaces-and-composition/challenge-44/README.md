# Challenge 44: Interface Segregation

**Difficulty:** ⭐⭐⭐ Hard | **Time:** 25 min

Apply the Interface Segregation Principle - clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use.

## Tasks
1. Create multiple small, focused interfaces instead of one large interface
2. Implement types that satisfy only what they need

```bash
go test -v
```
